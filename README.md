# Task

The project was made using create-react-app. I have more experience with react than with vanilla js.<br>
The styles were written using the css module.<br>

## Info

In fact, I was able to go through all the points that were required. Filtering the data made a small problem for me, I only managed to filter the tags. Showing and hiding filters. The responsiveness is exactly what I wanted it to look like.
I also made custom checkboxes and additional accessibility. Finally, I added the book data to the .json file and then fetch it directly from the file.
Most of the logic is in the file `./src/pages/Page.js`

## Data fetched from:

```
./public/data.json
```
